* Talos Whole Body Controller (WIP)

This is an attempt to create a simple Whole Body Controller from
scratch. The controller is highly inspired from the works:

- Bouyarmane, K., Caron, Stéphane, Escande, A., & Kheddar, A., Multi-contact motion planning and control, In A. Goswami, & P. Vadakkepat (Eds.), Humanoid Robotics: A Reference (pp. 1763–1804) (2019). Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands.
- Salini, J., Barthélemy, Sébastien, Bidaud, P., & Padois, V., Whole-body motion synthesis with lqp-based controller -- application to icub, In K. Mombaur, & K. Berns (Eds.), Modeling, Simulation and Optimization of Bipedal Walking (pp. 199–210) (2013). Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

This controller makes use of the excellent [[https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp][osqp]] QP solver and the
[[https://github.com/robotology/osqp-eigen][osqp-eigen]] C++ interface.

* How to use

** Docker

This repository ships with a =Dockerfile= to create a fully functional
image ready to be used. To create it, run this command while being
inside this repo:

#+begin_src bash
  docker build -t ros_talos .
#+end_src

This will create an image with the name =ros_talos=. To launch it, do
it with the script provided:

#+begin_src bash
  ./run_container.sh
#+end_src

This script includes this repo inside the catkin workspace. That way
you can modify the controller from the host. You may need to run these
commands with =sudo=, depending on how =docker= is set up in your
machine.

To access the container, open your browser and go to
=localhost:6080=. You should be able to view the container's desktop
after a few seconds.

Read the [[Compiling]] and [[How to use]] sections to learn how to compile the
workspace and run the controller inside a simulation.

** Raw installation
*** Dependencies

- ROS Melodic (tested on Debian 9).
- PAL Robotics' Talos ROS packages: http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/TALOS/Tutorials/Installation/Simulation
- Pinocchio (do not install =ros-melodic-pinocchio=): https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html

*** Compiling

Make sure you have the package =python-catkin-tools= installed. Then, in your catkin workspace, run:

#+begin_src bash
  catkin build --force-cmake -DCATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING=false
#+end_src

*** How to use

The first step is to launch the Gazebo physics simulator:

#+begin_src bash
  roslaunch talos_gazebo talos_gazebo.launch
#+end_src

We can now load our controller:

#+begin_src bash
  roslaunch talos_wbc_controller talos_trajectory_wbc_controller.launch
#+end_src

The robot will remain still, waiting for a trajectory to follow. You
can change the QP formulation parameters at any time using =rqt=:

#+begin_src bash
  rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
#+end_src

The controller is waiting for trajectories to be sent to the
=/talos_trajectory_wbc_controller/command= topic. The message type is
=talos_wbc_controller::JointContactTrajectory=, and can send joint and
center of mass trajectories, as well as link contacts with the world.

Trajectories can be generated in advance using any planning
framework. Using my fork of [[https://github.com/noctrog/towr][towr]] and the package [[https://github.com/noctrog/xpp_talos][xpp_talos]], simple
walking gaits can be generated and sent to this controller (TODO
explain how).
